This is a fun project which generates a pink robot with your description of it. If you like your robot, you can mint it as NFT on Astar Network. The NFT contract is minted as Native (WASM) contract and it uses PSP34 standard. It is also compatible with RMRK-ink and can be used as a RMRK_child.

The NFTs are visible at the marketplaces: ArtZero and Paras.
## Astar Deployment

The pink-robot contract is deployed to Astar at the following address:
